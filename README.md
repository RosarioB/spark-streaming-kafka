# spark-streaming-kafka
In this repository we will read the data stored in a Kafka topic and apply some transformations on them by making use of Spark Structured Streaming.
Each branch has different feature:
- `python` makes use of Jupyter notebooks and pyspark
- `scala` makes use of a Maven project in Scala.
